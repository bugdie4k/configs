# This is a sample commands.py.  You can add your own commands here.
#
# Please refer to commands_full.py for all the default commands and a complete
# documentation.  Do NOT add them all here, or you may end up with defunct
# commands when upgrading ranger.

# You always need to import ranger.api.commands here to get the Command class:
from ranger.api.commands import *
